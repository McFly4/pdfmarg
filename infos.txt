• Safety & redundancy systems (Class 1E)
• Instrumentation & control (I&C) networks
• Switchyard & grid connection interface

Hedging logic
Copper exposure → direct hedge via LME copper
• Aluminium exposure → LME aluminium
• Non-traded finished cables → proxy hedging on embedded metals
• Possibility to structure hedges:
◦ By construction milestones
◦ By progressive cable installation schedule
Electrical infrastructure represents a large, early and highly hedgeable metal exposure,
dominated by copper content.
🟦 SLIDE 7 — Construction (3/5): Piping & Fluid Systems
Embedded Stainless Steel & Nickel Exposure
(EPR – Flamanville reference | Order of magnitude)
Scope (fluid & piping systems)
• Primary & secondary cooling circuits
• Steam lines and condensate systems
• Safety-related fluid networks
• Auxiliary cooling and water treatment systems
• Valves, fittings, pumps casings (metallic parts)
Key materials involved
Stainless steels: austenitic grades (304 / 316 equivalents)
Alloy steels: low-alloy & high-spec steels
Critical alloying metals: nickel, chromium, molybdenum
Carbon steel: for non-safety auxiliary systems
Commodity exposure principle
Piping systems are non-traded industrial products; commodity exposure refers to the embedded
metal content, in particular stainless steel and its alloying elements.
Methodology (how quantities are derived)

✅ Total piping-related metal exposure (illustrative): ~€85m – €120m
Hedging logic
• Finished pipes are not traded
• Cost is driven by:
◦ Stainless steel prices
◦ Nickel content (major volatility driver)
• Proxy hedging strategy:
◦ Direct nickel hedge (LME)
◦ Partial steel hedge (HRC / scrap proxies)
• Suitable for:
◦ Phased hedging (aligned with piping installation)
◦ Long lead-time procurement coverage
One-line takeaway
Piping systems create a material, mid-construction exposure to stainless steel and nickel, with
strong proxy hedgeability via LME nickel.
🟦 SLIDE 8 — Construction (4/5): Conventional Island
Turbines, Alternators & Mechanical Systems
(EPR – Flamanville reference | Order of magnitude)
Scope (conventional island)

👉 Partie non nucléaire, mais forte intensité matière et valeur unitaire élevée.
Key materials involved
Carbon & alloy steels: forged steel, plates, shafts
Copper: alternator windings
Special alloys: nickel-based & chromium steels (high temperature / stress)
Aluminium: secondary mechanical components
Commodity exposure principle
Equipment is not traded; commodity exposure reflects the embedded metals used in turbines and
generators.
Methodology (how quantities are derived)
1. 2. 3. 4. Identify main rotating equipment (turbine + alternator)
Estimate mass of each equipment (industrial benchmarks)
Split mass by material type (steel vs copper vs alloys)

✅ Total conventional island metal exposure (illustrative): ~€70m – €105m
Hedging logic
• Steel exposure → proxy via HRC / scrap / iron ore
• Copper exposure → direct hedge via LME copper
• Alloy exposure → partial hedge via nickel
• Long manufacturing lead times → pre-hedging opportunities
One-line takeaway
The conventional island concentrates high-value embedded metals, combining steel mass and
copper intensity, making it a strong candidate for structured hedging.
🟦 SLIDE 9 — Construction (5/5): Nuclear Island
Fuel, Zirconium & Strategic Materials Exposure
(EPR – Flamanville reference | Order of magnitude)
Scope (nuclear island)
• Reactor pressure vessel & internals
• Fuel assemblies (initial core loading)
• Control rods
• Fuel cladding
• Nuclear-grade structural components
👉 Partie hautement réglementée, peu standardisable, mais exposition matière réelle.
Key materials involved
Fuel cycle: uranium (U₃O₈ → enriched fuel)
Cladding: zirconium alloys (zircaloy)
Structural metals: nuclear-grade steels
Absorbers: boron (control systems)
Commodity exposure principle
Nuclear materials are not fully hedgeable through standard markets; exposure analysis is primarily
strategic and economic, rather than trading-oriented.

✅ Total nuclear island economic exposure (illustrative): ~€90m – €125m
Hedging & strategic considerations (important nuance)
• Uranium:
◦ Illiquid vs LME metals
◦ Long-term contracts dominate
◦ Price risk is real but managed differently
• Zirconium:
◦ Highly specialized market
◦ No direct hedging instruments
• Steel:
◦ Partial proxy hedging possible
👉 This phase is less trading-oriented, but critical for full lifecycle risk mapping.
One-line takeaway
The nuclear island represents a strategic, less liquid exposure, completing the construction risk
map even if standard hedging solutions are limited.
🟦 SLIDE 10 — Electricity Generation Phase
Power Price Exposure & Revenue Risk
(EPR – Flamanville reference | Order of magnitude)
Scope (power generation phase)
• Electricity production and sales
• Interaction with wholesale power markets
• Long-term revenue exposure over plant lifetime (40–60 years)
Commodity exposure principle
During the generation phase, exposure shifts from input commodities to electricity price risk and
revenue volatility.
Methodology (how figures are derived)
1. 2. 3. 4. Define installed capacity: EPR ≈ 1.6 GW
Apply load factor (capacity factor)
Convert into annual electricity output (MWh)
Translate production into € revenue exposure using power price assumptions
Indicative electricity production
• Installed capacity: 1.6 GW
• Load factor (long-term average): 80–90%
• Annual operating hours: 8,760 h

(illustrative ranges – no price forecast implied)
Risk drivers
• Wholesale power prices
• Regulatory frameworks (CfD, price caps, state support)
• Demand–supply balance (baseload vs intermittent renewables)
• Fuel & carbon price interactions (indirect)
Hedging & structuring logic
• Long-term power price exposure → forward sales / structured hedges
• Possibility to design:
◦ Fixed-price revenue profiles
◦ Floor / collar structures
◦ Progressive hedging over operating life
One-line takeaway
Electricity generation creates a large, recurring revenue exposure, opening the door to long-dated
power hedging and structured solutions.
🟦 SLIDE 11 — Maintenance & OPEX Phase
Recurring Commodity Exposure Over Plant Lifetime
(EPR – Flamanville reference | Order of magnitude)
Scope (operations & maintenance)

👉 Phase moins visible, mais très intéressante commercialement car récurrente et prévisible.
Commodity exposure principle
Unlike construction CAPEX, OPEX exposures are recurring, creating opportunities for rolling and
long-term hedging strategies.
Methodology (how figures are derived)

Lifetime perspective
• Operating life: 40–60 years
• Cumulative OPEX commodity exposure:
👉 €600m – €1.2bn (undiscounted, illustrative)
Hedging & structuring logic
• Rolling hedges on:
◦ Metals (Cu, Ni, steel proxies)
◦ Energy (diesel, power)
• Long-term fuel supply contracts
• Potential for:
◦ Multi-year frameworks
◦ Index-linked pricing
◦ Portfolio-level hedging (fleet of reactors)

Maintenance transforms nuclear assets into long-duration, repeatable commodity clients, well-
suited for structured and rolling hedging solutions.
